# 4 - Pokedex

The Pokedex page centralizes the pokedex of all saves, as well as the PKVault pokedex.
The display takes into account species, forms, genders and shiny.

Several filters allow you to get aggregated information about your saves and storage.
You can for example display a custom living-dex, a shiny-dex, etc.

Synchronizing the pokedex between your saves and storage is possible from the storage page (see [Actions on pokémons](./3-storage.md#actions-on-pokemons)).
