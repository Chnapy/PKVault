# 2 - Session

All actions performed are limited to the current session.

No changes are saved as long as the session is not saved.
The saves and files are not modified.

Actions can be undone before saving.

Once saved, the session's actions are applied to the files (storage, saves) and the session is then recreated. A backup is always created before, so it is always possible to go back.
