## Scope and Limitations

PKVault uses PKHeX internally for pokémon and save manipulation, but is not intended to offer the same features.

Beyond PKVault's primary features, the app may offer secondary comfort features: trade evolution, move changes, etc. But PKVault will not offer editing options that go beyond classic & daily usage.

PKVault does not encourage cheating beyond comfort options.

PKVault can:

- read saves
- modify and move pokemons
- create pokemon variants

PKVault cannot:

- modify pokemon stats/IVs
- intentionally create illegal pokemons
- directly modify the games themselves
