# PKVault.Backend

All the logic & data manipulation (including save) is done here. It's also where PKHeX & PokeApi data are used.

Dependencies & versions can be found in [PKVault.Backend.csproj](./PKVault.Backend.csproj).

## Setup

Generate PokeApi data & spritesheets.
This process picks only the data used by the app & compress it as `.json.gz` files, and generates spritesheets.

```
dotnet run -p:Mode=gen-pokeapi
```

## Dev

```

Then you can use swagger: `http://localhost:5000/swagger`

## Build
